// The function that defines a procedural macro takes a TokenStream as an input
// and produces a TokenStream as an output.
//
// The TokenStream type is defined by the proc_macro crate that is included with
// Rust and represents a sequence of tokens.
//
// This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is operating on
// makes up the input TokenStream, and the code the macro produces is the output
// TokenStream.
//
// The function also has an attribute attached to it that specifies which kind
// of procedural macro weâ€™re creating. We can have multiple kinds of procedural
// macros in the same crate.
