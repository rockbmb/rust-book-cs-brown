IMPORTANT

| This works differently from defining a struct that uses a generic type parameter
| with trait bounds. A generic type parameter can only be substituted with one
| concrete type at a time, whereas trait objects allow for multiple concrete types
| to fill in for the trait object at runtime.

If this were to be the definition of the `Screen` struct,
then we would still have polymorphism, but homogeneous collections
at compile time since the `T` would have to be a stable concrete
type throughout the program which implemented `Draw`, and *not*
a variety of possible types which did.

| If youâ€™ll only ever have homogeneous collections, using generics and trait bounds
| is preferable because the definitions will be monomorphized at compile time to
| use the concrete types.
